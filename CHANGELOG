V3.8.1 (2021.2)

New functions
    sequences 
        prints both canonical and structural sequences (protein or NA).

Extended functions
    mutateside
        added support for mutation of DNA/RNA residues
        --na_seq allows to set a desired final sequence in a single operation (for DNA duplexes) 
    chains 
        allows to select chains according to molecular type (protein | dna | rna | na). 
        Improved guess of chain type.
    getss 
        can now mark CYS residues as part of SSBonds. Further commands like add_hydrogen reacts accordingly
    load
        can now be used to convert downloaded cif to pdb format using --force_save
    Modeller based commands
        adapted to support Modeller >= 10.1
    several commands
        adapted to work with NA chains

Extended support for verbosity
    Default verbosity has been reduced to errors and warnigs
    --nv --quiet removes all progress reports
    -v  adds extra progress report (original default)
 
Bugs fixed
    - clashes, add_hydrogen did not work for modified or cap residues 
    - mutateside crashed when trying to delete already modified atoms
    - added error message when chains will remove all chains in the structure
    - added error message when mutateside has no available mutations
    
================================================================================
v3.7.3 (2021.1)

Added support for biopython 1.78

Bugs fixed
    backbone
    - added error messages for incorrect or missing FASTA sequences
    - backbone reconstruction crashed when not all chains sequences were available even if missing chains where not needed
        
================================================================================
v3.0.2

New functions
    --rename_terms
        Rename N and C terms as NXXX, CXXX

Extended functions:
    mutateside & fixside --rebuild
        Uses Modeller for building the side chains, includes conformational search
    backbone --extra_gap
        Allow to use more residues from the built model to fill backbone breaks
    add_hydrogen --add_charges
        Adds point charges to atoms and produces a PDBQT output suitable for autodock

Bug fixes
    --debug
        Psutils import failed even when --debug was not requested
    backbone
        Residue internal pointers corrupted when backbone was modified
